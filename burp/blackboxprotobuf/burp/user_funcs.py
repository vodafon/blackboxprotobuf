# Documentation for Common parameters:
#   content -- Binary content of the request
#   is_request -- boolean, True for a request, False for a response
#   content_info -- RequestInfo or ResponseInfo object, See
#       https://portswigger.net/Burp/extender/api/burp/IRequestInfo.html and
#       https://portswigger.net/Burp/extender/api/burp/IResponseInfo.html

#   request/request_content_info -- If called on a response, send the
#       corresponding request (useful for retrieving URL parameters)

# Useful functionality:
#    URL parameters:

#    Request Body:
#       body = content[content_info.getBodyOffset():].tostring()
#    Setting paramater:
#       import burp.IParameter
